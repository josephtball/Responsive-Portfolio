						<p>My name is Joseph Ball and I am studying to be a full-stack web developer at Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. I have a background in electrical work and construction management but I was unsatisfied with that career path. I have decided to make the change to web development because I have always had an interest in tech, coding, and creating new things. I also enjoy the challenge of learning something new.</p>
						<p>When I'm not studying web development I like to go mountain biking, which is probably my newest hobby. I usually ride trails at Allaire, Holmdel, and Hartshorne Park with some friends. It's a good way to make exercise fun. During the winter months I go skiing. I have been skiing for as long as I can remember and try to go as often as possible since the season is rather short.</p>
